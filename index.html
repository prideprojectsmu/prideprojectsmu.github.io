				<h1>About</h1>
				<!--<p>LGBT history on SMU's campus reaches back decades, and often showcases the struggles of queer students to express themselves freely on campus. At the same time, there have been many hard-won victories for queer representation, including the chartering of GLSSO and the establishment of a Queer senator position.</p>

				<p>Founded by SMU senior and Queer Senator Bri Tollie, PRIDE@SMU is a student-led, interdisciplinary research team investigating LGBTQ+ history and experiences at SMU. The project launched in August 2021 with the help of SMU’s Office of Engaged Learning and over 10 campus partners and mentors. Since its launch, the PRIDE team has interviewed 14 queer SMU students, faculty, staff, and alumni, as well as hosted the first-ever Queer State of the University Address at SMU on February 11th, 2022. Along with this event, this research is contributing to the In Search of Belongingexhibit, as well as informing students and administrators for ongoing community event planning and campus policy reform. Managed by a diverse group of LGBTQ+ students and allies, PRIDE@SMU combines archival, oral, and institutional history to better understand the queer community's roots at SMU.</p>

				<h1>Meet the Team</h1>
				<!--<p>Within the DeGolyer Library archives, clippings of Daily Campus articles, Senate minutes, notes from the very first GLSSO meetings, and more help cast light on the foundation of queer student activism and community here at SMU.</p>-->
				<p>Our interdisciplinary team highlights the diversity across SMU and the greater Dallas community. Led by Bri Tollie and Leia Hannum, our research, film, and social taskforces have worked hard to make this project what it is today.</p>
